      We have chosen to trace the history of image and representation across historical periods, with the understanding that representation never stands on its own, but is also intricately linked to the social, political and economic situation of an era. Looking at American history from the early twentieth century until now, tracing major events like the Civil Rights Movement, queer liberation, the Vietnam War, 9/11 and much more, we can begin to formulate a theory of representation that goes beyond looking at an individual image, and instead see it as part of larger narratives pushed by various forces — American governmental propaganda, major Hollywood corporations, or the people. Situating representation within the context it emerged allows us to better understand the way that media has been used to shape, reframe or deliberately alter our perceptions of ourselves and one another, as well as to see the power and opportunity that image-making and representations have to shift the future.

        Furthermore, we have chosen to examine periods particularly strife with political or social unrest, understanding that those periods offer both the largest opportunities for change as well as the largest motivation of large media corporations to reinforce or create new stereotypes and images that would reassert political and social hierarchies when they seemed to be shifting in reality. From this, we can understand how representation has been used historically to react to and shape reactions of social and political events, and think more critically about useful or productive representation might be.

  To do this, we look at six distinct historical periods, beginning with the 1900s to 1940s, as this is the rise of early cinema and also of great political unrest in the country, given the proliferation of Jim Crow segregation in the South, World War I, and the accompanying rise of film and moving images. From there, we move to the 1950s and 60s, looking at the Civil Rights Movement, queer liberation movement, Chicanx power movement, as well as the women’s rights movement. In a period with such strong political mobilization and grassroots organizing, it becomes especially clear the ways that representation is both a tool of the oppressor and oppressed. We see a next major political shift in the 1980s, with the rise of mass incarceration, the Just Say No campaign and the growth of the war on drugs and the rise of a “superpredator” narrative. These particular political campaigns give a clear look at how political campaigns are reinforced and enabled by representations in popular culture.

        From here, we move to the 1990s, unique for its wide ranging diversity and representation on screen — examining how and why this became possible. Then we aim to look at the 2000s and several major political events of the era; Hurricane Katrina and 9/11 both being particularly strong forces of narratives emerging from this time period and reshaping American representations of the Other. Finally, we examine a contemporary period, which we’ve defined as beginning around 2010 up until the present day. Marked primarily by a rise of digital media and social media culture, this period aims to explore the impacts of a dominant visual culture and its corresponding effects on race and racial representations.
